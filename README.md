# Matasano Crypto Challenges

## Set 1: The basics
[x] 1. Convert hex to base64
[x] 2. Fixed XOR
[x] 3. Single-byte XOR cipher
[x] 4. Detect single-character XOR
[x] 5. Implement single-character XOR
[x] 6. Break repeating-key XOR
[x] 7. AES in ECB mode
[x] 8. Detect AES in ECB mode

## Set 2: Block crypto
[x] 9. Implement PKCS#7 padding
[x] 10. Implement CBC mode
[x] 11. An ECB/CBC detection oracle
[x] 12. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Simple)
[x] 13. ECB cut-and-paste
[x] 14. Byte-at-a-time ECB decryption (Harder)
[x] 15. PKCS#7 padding validation
[x] 16. CBC bitflipping attacks

## Note
If you find a mistake in one of my solutions, I welcome you to let me know! 

Since the entire point of doing this is learning, it would be especially kind of you to only give me a small hint so I have to figure it out myself :)
